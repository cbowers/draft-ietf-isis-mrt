    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes necessary extensions to IS-IS to
      support the distributed computation of Maximally Redundant Trees
      (MRT). Some example uses of the MRTs include IP/LDP Fast-Reroute
      and global protection or live-live for multicast traffic. The
      extensions indicate what MRT profile(s) each router
      supports. Different MRT profiles can be defined to support
      different uses and to allow transition of capabilities. An
      extension is introduced to flood MRT-Ineligible links, due to
      administrative policy.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The IS-IS protocol is specified in [ISO10589], with
      extensions for supporting IPv4 and IPv6 specified in <xref
      target="RFC1195"/> and <xref target="RFC5308"/>. Each
      Intermediate System (IS) (router) advertises one or more IS-IS
      Link State Protocol Data Units (LSPs) with routing
      information. Each LSP is composed of a fixed header and a number
      of tuples, each consisting of a Type, a Length, and a
      Value. Such tuples are commonly known as TLVs, and are a good
      way of encoding information in a flexible and extensible
      format.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture"/> gives a
      complete solution for IP/LDP fast-reroute using Maximally
      Redundant Trees (MRT) to provide alternates. This document
      describes signalling extensions for supporting
      MRT-FRR in an IS-IS routing domain.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements Language">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
      in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>Redundant Trees (RT): A pair of trees where the path from any
      node X to the root R along the first tree is node-disjoint with
      the path from the same node X to the root R along the second
      tree. These can be computed in 2-connected graphs.</t>

      <t>Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT): A pair of trees where the
      path from any node X to the root R along the first tree and the
      path from the same node X to the root R along the second tree
      share the minimum number of nodes and the minimum number of
      links. Each such shared node is a cut-vertex. Any shared links
      are cut-links. Any RT is an MRT but many MRTs are not RTs.</t>

      <t>MRT Island: From the computing router, the set of routers
      that support a particular MRT profile and are connected via MRT-
      eligible links.</t>

      <t>GADAG: Generalized Almost Directed Acyclic Graph - a graph
      which is the combination of the ADAGs of all
      blocks. Transforming a network graph into a GADAG is part of the
      MRT algorithm.</t>

      <t>MRT-Red: MRT-Red is used to describe one of the two MRTs; it
      is used to describe the associated forwarding topology and
      MT-ID. Specifically, MRT-Red is the decreasing MRT where links
      in the GADAG are taken in the direction from a higher
      topologically ordered node to a lower one.</t>

      <t>MRT-Blue: MRT-Blue is used to describe one of the two MRTs;
      it is used to describe the associated forwarding topology and
      MT-ID.  Specifically, MRT-Blue is the increasing MRT where links
      in the GADAG are taken in the direction from a lower
      topologically ordered node to a higher one.</t>
    </section>

	
	
    <section title="Overview of IS-IS Signalling Extensions for MRT">
      <t>As stated in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm"/>, it is necessary for
      each MRT-Capable router to compute MRT next hops in a consistent
      fashion. This is achieved by using same MRT profile and
      selecting the unique root in a MRT Island which is connected by
      MRT-Eligible links. Each of these issues will be discussed in
      following sections separately.</t>

      <section title="Supporting MRT Profiles">
        <t>The contents and requirements of an MRT profile has been
        defined in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture"/>. The parameters
        and behavioral rules contained in an MRT profile define one
        router's MRT capabilities. Based on common capabilities, one
        unified MRT Island is built.</t>

        <t>The MRT-Capable router MUST advertise its corresponding MRT
        profiles by IS-IS protocol extension within IS-IS routing
        domain. The capabilities of advertiser MUST conform to the
        profile it claimed completely, especially the MT-IDs, the
        algorithm and the corresponding forwarding mechanism. This
        advertisement MUST have level scope. One router MAY support
        multiple MRT profiles and it MUST advertise these profiles in
        corresponding IS-IS level. The MT- IDs used in one supported
        MRT Profile MUST NOT overlap with those MT- IDs used in a
        different supported MRT Profile.</t>

        <t>The default MRT Profile is defined in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture"/>. Its behavior
        is intended to support IP/LDP unicast and multicast
        Fast-Reroute.  MRT-Capable routers SHOULD support the default
        MRT profile.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Selecting GADAG Root">
        <t>As per <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm"/>, a
        GADAG root MUST be selected for one MRT Island. An unique
        GADAG root in common-sense among MRT Island routers is a
        necessity to do MRT computation. Since the selection of the
        GADAG root can affect the alternates and the traffic through
        it, the selection rules give network operator a knob to
        control the alternates and the traffic inside the MRT
        Island. Relevant discussion for the relationship between GADAG
        root role and MRT Island alternates is out of the scope of
        this document.</t>

        <t>Each MRT-Capable router MUST advertise its priority for
        GADAG root selection. One router can only have one priority in
        the same MRT Island. It can have multiple priorities for
        different MRT Islands it supports. Routers that are marked as
        overloaded(<xref target="RFC3787"/>) are not qualified as
        candidate for root selection.</t>

<t>The GADAG Root Selection Policy (defined as part of an MRT profile)
may make use of the GADAG Root Selection Priority value advertised in
the MRT Profile in the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV.  For example, the
GADAG Root Selection Policy for the default MRT profile is the
following: Among the routers in the MRT Island and with the highest
priority advertised, an implementation MUST pick the router with the
highest Router ID to be the GADAG root.</t>

        <t>When the current root is out of service or new router with
        higher priority joined into the MRT Island, the GADAG root
        MUST be re-selected. A new MRT computation will be triggered
        because of such a topology change.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Advertising MRT-Ineligible Links for MRT">
        <t>For certain administrative or management reason, some links
        may not be involved into MRT computation. In this scenario,
        MRT-Capable router MUST claim those MRT-Ineligible links are
        out of MRT Island scope. If such claim splits current MRT
        Island then MRT computation has to be done inside the modified
        MRT Island which the computing router belongs to.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Triggering an MRT Computation">
        <t>A MRT Computation can be triggered through topology changes
        or MRT capability changes of any router in the MRT Island. It
        is always triggered for a given MRT Profile in the
        corresponding level. First, the associated MRT Island is
        determined. Then, the GADAG Root is selected. Finally, the
        actual MRT algorithm is run to compute the transit MRT-Red and
        MRT-Blue topologies. Additionally, the router MAY choose to
        compute MRT-FRR alternates or make other use of the MRT
        computation results.</t>

        <t>Prefixes can be attached and detached and have their
        associated MRT- Red and MRT-Blue next-hops computed without
        requiring a new MRT computation.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="MRT Capability Advertisement">
      <t>MRT-Capable router MUST identify its MRT capabilities through
      IS-IS Link State Packet(LSP) in level scope.</t>

<section title="MRT Profile sub-TLV in the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV">
<t>A new MRT Profile sub-TLV is introduced into the IS-IS Router
CAPABILITY TLV (TLV #242 defined in <xref target="RFC4971"/>) to advertise MRT
capabilities.  Since MRT has per level scope, the S-bit and
D-bit of IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV MUST be set to zero. The
structure of the MRT Profile sub-TLV is pictured as below:</t>

<t>TYPE: TBA-MRT-ISIS-1 (To Be Allocated by IANA)</t>

<t>LENGTH: 4</t>

<t>VALUE:</t>

<t>MT-ID (2 octets with 4 bits reserved)</t>

<t>MRT Profile ID (1 octet)</t>

<t>GADAG Root Selection Priority (1 octet)</t>

<figure align="center">

</figure>

<t>MT-ID is a 12-bit field containing the non-zero multi-topology ID.
As discussed in <xref target ="sec_multitopology"/>, this document specifies that
the MT-ID field MUST be set to zero. </t>

<t>The MRT Profile ID represents the MRT profile this router supports.</t>

<t> The GADAG Root Selection Priority is the priority for selection as 
GADAG root. A router advertising the MRT Profile sub-TLV MUST specify a 
GADAG Root Selection Priority. The range of this priority is [0, 255]. 
The RECOMMENDED default value of the GADAG Root Selection Priority is 
128. The GADAG Root Selection Policy defined as part of a given MRT 
profile determines how the GADAG Root Selection Priority value is 
used.</t> 

<t>This sub-TLV can occur multiple times if a router supports multiple 
MRT profiles. This can happen during a network transition. Or it can be 
used to support different uses of MRT within the same network which may 
perform better with different profiles.</t> 

<section title="A note on the M-bit in OSPF"> <t><xref 
target="I-D.ietf-ospf-mrt"/> define MRT signalling extensions for OSPF. 
In addition to the OSPF version of MRT Profile sub-TLV (which is carried 
in the OSPF Router Information LSA), it also define the M-bit (which is 
carried in the OSPF Router-LSA.) As discussed in <xref 
target="I-D.ietf-ospf-mrt"/>, the M-bit in the Router-LSA ensures that 
all routers in the area have up-to-date information if a router is 
downgraded to a software version that does not support MRT and the 
Router Information LSA.</t> 

<t>The problematic scenario that requires the M-bit in the OSPF 
Router-LSA does not occur in IS-IS. The presence or absence of an IS-IS 
Router CAPABILITY TLV containing a given MRT Profile sub-TLV in the 
IS-IS Link State PDU provides enough information for all routers to 
determine which remote routers support MRT, even after a software 
version downgrade of remote routers. Therefore, this document does not 
define a corresponding M-bit for IS-IS. </t> 

</section>

</section>

<section title="MRT-Ineligible Link sub-TLV in the Extended IS Reachability TLV">
<t>As a matter of policy, an operator may choose to mark some links as 
ineligible for carrying MRT traffic. For instance, policy can be made to 
prevent fast-rerouted traffic from taking those links.</t> 

<t>For a link to be marked as ineligible for use in the MRT calculation, it MUST be 
advertised including the MRT-Ineligible Link sub-TLV in the Extended IS 
Reachability TLV (TLV #22 defined in <xref target="RFC5305"/> ) 
corresponding to the ineligible link. The MRT-Ineligible Link sub-TLV is 
a zero-length sub-TLV as below:</t> 

<t>TYPE: TBA-MRT-ISIS-2 (To Be Allocated by IANA)</t>

<t>LENGTH: 0</t>

<t>VALUE: None</t>

<t>The presence of the zero-length MRT-Ineligible Link sub-TLV in the 
Extended IS Reachability TLV indicates that the associated link MUST NOT 
be used in the MRT calculation for all profiles.</t> 
</section>

<section anchor="sec_multitopology" title="A Note on Multi-Topology Routing">
<t>This document specifies how to signal support for MRT in the default 
routing topology.  The format of the extensions allows
the MRT Profile sub-TLV and the MRT-Ineligible 
Link sub-TLV to be scoped to topologies with non-zero MT-ID at some 
point in future.  However, this document restricts these extensions to apply 
only to the default topology.  The MRT Profile sub-TLV is
restricting by explicitly requiring the MT-ID field to be set to zero.
The MRT-Ineligible Link sub-TLV is restricted by only allowing it to 
be included in the Extended IS Reachability TLV (TLV#22) which is scoped to 
the default topology, and not allowing it to appear TLV#222 (the 
topology-scoped version of the Extended IS Reachability TLV). </t>

<t>Lifting these restrictions is for further study. Note that the MRT 
signalling extensions in this document can co-exist with IS-IS 
multi-topology routing, with the limitation that MRT Red and 
Blue forwarding trees would only be built for the default 
topology.</t> 
 
 <t>The format of the Controlled Convergence sub-TLV (discussed below) 
also contains an MT-ID field, allowing a Controlled Convergence sub-TLV 
to be scoped to a particular topology. This document does not place 
restrictions on the MT-ID field in the Controlled Convergence sub-TLV. 
The Controlled Convergence sub-TLV has potential applications that are 
not limited to MRT, and a topology-scoped FIB compute/install time makes 
sense on its own.</t> 
 
</section>

</section>
	
<section title="Controlled Convergence sub-TLV in IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV">
<t>Section 12.2 of <xref target ="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture"/> 
describes the need to wait for a configured or advertised period after a 
network failure to insure that all routers are using their new SPTs. 
Similarly, avoiding micro-forwarding loops during convergence <xref 
target="RFC5715"/> requires determining the maximum among all routers in 
the area of the worst-case route computation and FIB installation time. 
More details on the specific reasoning and need for flooding this value 
are given in <xref target="I-D.atlas-bryant-shand-lf-timers"/>.</t> 

<t>A new Controlled Convergence sub-TLV is introduced into the IS-IS 
Router CAPABILITY TLV (TLV #242 defined in <xref target="RFC4971"/>) to 
advertise the worst-case time for a router to compute and install all 
IS-IS routes in the level after a change to a stable network. This 
advertisement has per level scope, so the S-bit and D-bit of IS-IS 
Router CAPABILITY TLV MUST be set to zero.</t> 

<t>The structure of the Controlled Convergence sub-TLV is
shown below:</t>

<t>TYPE: TBA-MRT-ISIS-3 (To Be Allocated by IANA)</t>

<t>LENGTH: 1</t>

<t>VALUE:</t>

<t>FIB compute/install time (1 octet)</t>

</figure>
		
<t>The FIB compute/install time is the worst-case time the router may
take to compute and install all IS-IS routes in the level after a
change to a stable network.  The value is in milliseconds.</t>

<t>The FIB compute/install time value sent by a router SHOULD be an
estimate taking into account network scale or real-time measurements,
or both.  Advertisements SHOULD be dampened to avoid frequent
communication of small changes in the FIB compute/install time.</t>

<t>A router receiving the Controlled Convergence sub-TLV SHOULD
estimate the network convergence time as the maximum of the FIB
compute/install times advertised by the routers in a level, including
itself.  In order to account for routers that do not advertise the
Controlled Convergence sub-TLV, a router MAY use a locally configured
minimum network convergence time as a lower bound on the computed
network convergence time.  A router MAY use a locally configured
maximum network convergence time as an upper bound on the computed
network convergence time.
</t>

</section>
    <section title="Handling MRT Capability Sending and Receiving">
      <t>The M-bit which identifies router's MRT capability MUST be
      advertised in LSP fragment 0. Those MRT related sub-TLVs SHOULD
      be ignored when MRT Capability bit is unset. When changes in MRT
      capabilities are received, a MRT computation SHOULD be triggered
      but MAY be delayed for a while to allow reception of all
      MRT-related information.</t>

      <section title="Advertising MRT extension">
        <t>MRT sub-TLVs are encapsulated in the Router Capability TLV
        and advertised through LSP PDU for the level-wide. MRT
        sub-TLVs are optional. If one router does not support MRT, it
        MUST NOT advertise those sub-TLVs.</t>

        <t>Since the advertisement scope of the MRT sub-TLV is
        level-wide, the D-Bit and S-Bit of the Router Capability TLV
        MUST be set as 0 when it is advertised. If other sub-TLVs in
        the Router Capability TLV need different values for those two
        bits, there MUST be an independent Router Capability TLV for
        MRT sub-TLVs.</t>

        <t>When MRT related information is changed for the router or
        existing IS-IS LSP mechanisms are triggered for refreshing or
        updating, MRT sub-TLVs MUST be advertised if the router is
        MRT-Capable.</t>

        <t>For administrative policies or reasons, it may be desirable
        to exclude certain links from the MRT computation.
        MRT-Ineligible sub-TLV is used to advertise which links should
        be excluded. Note that an interface advertised as
        MRT-Ineligigle by a router is ineligible with respect to all
        profiles advertised by that router.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Parsing MRT extension">
        <t>MRT extension MUST NOT affect the peer setup and the
        routing calculation of the standard topology.</t>

        <t>MRT sub-TLVs SHOULD be validated like other sub-TLVs when
        received.  MRT sub-TLVs SHOULD also be taken for the checksum
        calculation and authentication.</t>

        <t>Links advertised in MRT-Ineligible sub-TLV MUST be
        precluded from MRT Computation. The removal of those links may
        change the computing router's MRT Island significantly.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Backwards Compatibility">
      <t>The M-bit for MRT capability, the MRT Profile sub-TLV and the
      MRT- Ineligible Link sub-TLV defined in this document SHOULD NOT
      introduce any interoperability issues. Routers that do not
      support these MRT extensions SHOULD silently ignore
      them. Alternates or traffic MUST NOT be affected in current
      IS-IS routing domain.</t>
